Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?
That's number 2.  Keep going!
Halfway there!
So you got that one.  Try this one.
Congratulations! You've (mostly) defused the bomb!
Hit Control-C to escape phase 6 (for free!), but if you want to
try phase 6 for extra credit, you can continue.  Just beware!
Curses, you've found the secret phase!
But finding it and solving it are quite different...
Wow! You've defused the secret stage!
Congratulations! You've defused the bomb! Again!
